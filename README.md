# THP-Android-App
-----------------

This app will incorporate IoT functions into my girlfriend's existing lamp that I made for her in June of 2022
The app will primarily be coded in Kotlin and will have:
* Client-side internal functions (no server-side as of 06/06/2023)
* Visually appealing and interactive ways to modify and wirelessly control the lights
* Potential for the incorporation of a display so that I can send fun messages to her across the United States
